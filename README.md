# MyshopFr

Starter Shopify theme scaffolded for a dropshipping storefront. The repo now matches Shopify's expected theme structure (layout, templates, sections, snippets, assets, config, locales) and includes a responsive top navigation section.

## Local preview

You can open `demo.html` to see the pre-fix navigation prototype or `previews/theme-preview.html` to view the current theme styling with the hero and feature cards. Both rely on the assets in `/assets`.
